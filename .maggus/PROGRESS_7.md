# PROGRESS_7.md — Engine Wiring Audit

**Date:** 2026-03-15
**Task:** TASK-AUD-001 — Read and Document the Full Engine Wiring

---

## Engine.cs — Full Wiring Map

`Engine.cs` has two main paths: **Extended Pipeline** (production+test) and **Engine Core** (protocol demux).

---

### Path 1: `BuildExtendedPipeline` (always used)

This wraps every request/response with business logic stages:

**Request chain (top → engine):**

| Stage | Class | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| RequestEnricherStage | `Streams/Stages/RequestEnricherStage.cs` | Applies BaseAddress, DefaultHeaders, DefaultVersion |
| MergePreferred (redirect feedback) | Akka built-in | Accepts re-queued redirect requests |
| CookieInjectionStage | `Streams/Stages/CookieInjectionStage.cs` | Injects cookies from shared CookieJar |
| MergePreferred (retry feedback) | Akka built-in | Accepts re-queued retry requests |
| CacheLookupStage | `Streams/Stages/CacheLookupStage.cs` | Out0=cache miss→engine, Out1=cache hit→merge |

**Engine core** (see below)

**Response chain (engine → output):**

| Stage | Class | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| DecompressionStage | `Streams/Stages/DecompressionStage.cs` | gzip/deflate/brotli |
| CookieStorageStage | `Streams/Stages/CookieStorageStage.cs` | Persists Set-Cookie into CookieJar |
| CacheStorageStage | `Streams/Stages/CacheStorageStage.cs` | Stores cacheable responses |
| RetryStage | `Streams/Stages/RetryStage.cs` | Out0=final, Out1=retry→retryMerge |
| Merge (cache hit + response) | Akka built-in | Merges cached and live responses |
| RedirectStage | `Streams/Stages/RedirectStage.cs` | Out0=final, Out1=redirect→redirectMerge |

---

### Path 2: `BuildEngineCoreGraph` — Test Mode (http10Factory != null)

Partitions into 3 protocol lanes (HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2):

| Lane | Protocol Engine | Builder |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Port 0 | Http10Engine | `BuildProtocolFlow<Http10Engine>(16, ActorRefs.Nobody, factory)` |
| Port 1 | Http11Engine | `BuildProtocolFlow<Http11Engine>(16, ActorRefs.Nobody, factory)` |
| Port 2 | Http20Engine | `BuildProtocolFlow<Http20Engine>(16, ActorRefs.Nobody, factory)` |

Each `BuildProtocolFlow` in test mode: `new TEngine().CreateFlow().Join(transportFactory())`
→ **No ConnectionStage used. Transport comes from the test factory.**

---

### Path 3: `BuildEngineCoreGraph` — Production Mode (http10Factory == null)

Partitions into 4 protocol lanes:

| Lane | Protocol Engine | maxSubstreams | Transport |
|------|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| Port 0 | Http10Engine | 256 | `ConnectionStage(poolRouter)` |
| Port 1 | Http11Engine | 256 | `ConnectionStage(poolRouter)` |
| Port 2 | Http20Engine | 64 | `ConnectionStage(poolRouter)` |
| Port 3 | Http30Engine | 32 | `ConnectionStage(poolRouter)` |

---

### Path 4: `BuildProtocolFlow` — Production substream wiring

Each protocol lane creates per-host substreams using `GroupBy(HostKey.FromRequest)`.

Within each substream (`BuildConnectionFlowPublic`):

| Component | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `TEngine().CreateFlow()` (BidiFlow) | Protocol encoding/decoding |
| `ConnectionStage(poolRouter)` | TCP transport, contacts `PoolRouterActor` for socket refs |
| `Broadcast<HttpRequestMessage>(2)` | Fans out first request to (a) BidiFlow and (b) connectOnce |
| `connectOnce` (Take(1).Select ConnectItem) | Extracts URI on first request → creates `ConnectItem` |
| `Concat<IOutputItem>(2)` | Sends ConnectItem first, then BidiFlow data |
| `Buffer(1, Backpressure)` | Decouples Broadcast from BidiFlow (deadlock prevention) |

## Key Answers

### Does `Engine.cs` use `ConnectionPoolStage`?

**NO.** There is no `ConnectionPoolStage` class anywhere in the codebase (confirmed by grep). The term "Actor Pool" refers to `PoolRouterActor` / `HostPoolActor`, which are actors — not Akka.Streams stages. `ConnectionStage` is the Akka.Streams stage that bridges the actor pool to the stream graph.

### Is `ConnectionReuseStage` actively wired?

**NO.** `ConnectionReuseStage` exists at `Streams/Stages/ConnectionReuseStage.cs` and has tests in `TurboHttp.StreamTests/Streams/ConnectionReuseStageTests.cs`, but it is **never referenced in `Engine.cs`** or any production code path. It is dead code from an earlier design iteration.

---

## Architecture Notes

- **`PoolRouterActor`** IS used in production: passed as `poolRouter: IActorRef` to `BuildProtocolFlow`, which passes it to `ConnectionStage`. So the actor pool IS integrated — but via the `ConnectionStage` bridge, not via a stream stage called "ConnectionPoolStage".
- **`GroupByHostKeyStage`** and **`MergeSubstreamsStage`** exist as custom stages but Engine.cs uses the built-in Akka `.GroupBy()` / `.MergeSubstreams()` DSL extensions directly instead.
- **`ExtractOptionsStage`** exists but is not wired in Engine.cs. Its former role (splitting `HttpRequest(Options, Message)`) may have been superseded by the current `RequestEnricherStage` + `requestOptionsFactory` pattern.

## TASK-AUD-002 — Plan 4 Actor Pool: Integration Status Check

**Date:** 2026-03-15

### Grep Results

**`ConnectionPoolStage`** — grep in all of `src/`: **0 matches**. This class does not exist anywhere in the codebase. It was removed during Plan 4b (TASK-4B-004/006).

**`PoolRouterActor`** — found in the following production files:

| File | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `src/TurboHttp/IO/PoolRouterActor.cs` | Definition |
| `src/TurboHttp/IO/Stages/ConnectionStage.cs` | `ConnectionStage` sends `PoolRouterActor.GetPoolRefs` to obtain stream refs |
| `src/TurboHttp/Streams/Engine.cs` | `CreateFlow(IActorRef poolRouter, ...)` — all `BuildProtocolFlow` calls pass `poolRouter` → `new ConnectionStage(poolRouter)` |
| `src/TurboHttp/Client/TurboClientStreamManager.cs` | Creates `PoolRouterActor` via `system.ActorOf(Props.Create(() => new PoolRouterActor(clientOptions.PoolConfig)), "pool-router")` and passes it to `engine.CreateFlow(poolRouter, ...)` |

**`HostPoolActor`** — found in `src/TurboHttp/IO/HostPoolActor.cs` (definition) and spawned by `PoolRouterActor` internally when a `ConnectItem` arrives. No direct references in Engine.cs or TurboClientStreamManager.

### Answer: Is the Actor Pool used in Engine.cs or TurboHttpClient?

**YES — fully integrated.**

The complete production path is:

```
TurboHttpClient.SendAsync()
  → TurboClientStreamManager
    → system.ActorOf(Props.Create(() => new PoolRouterActor(poolConfig)))
    → engine.CreateFlow(poolRouter, clientOptions)
      → Engine.BuildExtendedPipeline(poolRouter, ...)
        → Engine.BuildEngineCoreGraph(poolRouter, ...)
          → Engine.BuildProtocolFlow<Http10|11|20|30Engine>(poolRouter)
            → Engine.BuildConnectionFlowPublic(poolRouter)
              → new ConnectionStage(poolRouter)
                → on-start: poolRouter.Tell(GetPoolRefs())
                → receives PoolRefs(SinkRef<ITransportItem>, SourceRef<IDataItem>)
                → stream items flow through SinkRef/SourceRef ↔ actor hierarchy
```

The actor hierarchy inside `PoolRouterActor`:
- `PoolRouterActor` receives `ConnectItem` → spawns `HostPoolActor` per host
- `HostPoolActor` receives `DataItem` → spawns `ConnectionActor` per TCP connection
- `ConnectionActor` → `ClientManager` → `ClientRunner` + `ClientByteMover` → TCP

### Assessment: "If no, what would need to happen?"

N/A — the Actor Pool is already integrated. No integration work is required.

### Test Coverage

Stream tests (non-test code verification):
- `src/TurboHttp.StreamTests/IO/ActorHierarchyStreamRefTests.cs` — ETE-001: full hierarchy `ConnectItem` via SinkRef → HostPoolActor spawned → DataItem → ConnectionActor spawned → TCP outbound
- `src/TurboHttp.StreamTests/Streams/ConnectionStageTests.cs` — CS-001, CS-002: `ConnectionStage` talks to stub router, items flow in both directions
